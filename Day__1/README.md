I have done this task with the help of watching the youtube videos,and the given resources
as i was new to it, it took lot of time.
but now the concepts are clear.


I have used
 

##### isnull().sum()


to find the missed values but there was no such columns


##### describe()
to find the statistical values to find the IQR.


and used 


##### quantile() 

to find the percentile and thereby finding the upper and lower limit 
and found out the IQR.


this is how i have done the "Outliers"


And plot the Graphs as well


##### Stress vs Sleep &


##### Age vs Burnout
